* Talk to your friends
* Create a chat room
* Stay in the loop

Social media has become so driven to define and enhance your experience with an abundance of features that have diluted the main goal of interaction. With Bloc Chat, we're going back to the beginning of communication. Straight to the point, and without unnecessary features, Bloc Chat is where friends can just talk.

Bloc Chat was my first project, and was assigned to start putting my new skills to the test. This project was to prove to myself that I am capable of being of web developer, and showing my mentor that I am understanding what's being used. Bloc Chat is comprised of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and Firebase.

While Bloc Chat was supposed to test what I have learned, new concepts were required that I had no experience with that are necessary for Bloc Chat to function. Including and authenticating Firebase into my project was one of those new concepts. It allows the information created in Bloc Chat to be stored and pulled from whenever needed.

After several trials and errors dealing with the new Firebase design, the help and knowledge from my mentor allowed Bloc Chat to be created and finished free of bugs and issues.

Referencing Bloc Chat code from others with the outdated Firebase proved unhelpful and messy. With no references that were up to date I was worried about wasting time with countless trials and errors.

With the knowledge I have now, I would have been more cautious about leaving useless and duplicated code around, and would have had a page design before beginning the important work.

The design still needs to be finalized, but you know how CSS can be!
